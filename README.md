<a href="https://github.com/camiel1/Masters_Capstone/blob/master/Final_Paper.pdf">Final_Paper.pdf</a> in this repository represents the culmination of a semester long study on forecasting ocean waves using Time Series and Machine Learning techniques using R: a language and environment for statistical computing. In addition, this repository contains .R files for all models and visuals as well as data files for raw buoy data and bathymetry map data. Below you'll find the main title and abstract of this study.

  Ocean buoy data is used in and of itself to develop forecasts of significant wave height using
time series and machine learning techniques available in R: a language and environment for
statistical computing. By using R, data can be collected from ocean buoys directly and
used to produce reasonable multi step ahead forecasts. Southern California was used as the
study region, specifically using data from the Santa Monica Bay and San Clemente Basin
buoys. Models were evaluated using training and test data sets, with one model employing a
more complex nested cross validation schema. Error measures were lower when forecasting
data from the Santa Monica Bay buoy with one time series model and two separate machine
learning models producing mean absolute error measures of .293, .226, and .259 meters
respectively. These same models for the San Clemente Basin buoy produced mean absolute
error measures of .477, .394, and .374 meters respectively. Ultimately, the methodologies
used and workflows developed may prove to be a viable framework for data scientists who
wish to study and forecast ocean waves.
